BNetCommander is a tool for editing battle.net gateways, letting you re-order, edit, or add new gateways to the list.  It can edit gateways for StarCraft, Diablo 2, and WarCraft 3.

I'm no longer able to support it so I put the latest source up on here in case others might want to support it.  There's some source floating around but I think it's old.
